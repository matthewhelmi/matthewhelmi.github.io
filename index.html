    <div class="project-abstract">
Lattice contributions to the screened Coulomb interaction (W) of the GW formalism are implemented via the dielectric function. An expression for the lattice susceptibility is derived involving the effective Born-charge. Upon inclusion of the lattice susceptibility to the total dielectric function, the conventional electronic contribution is separated from the lattice contribution. The self-energy containing the lattice contribution is solved by a contour integral, thus capturing the dynamics of the lattice effects. A close analysis is presented for the volume confinement of W in q-space, by deriving appropriate expressions in the limits of q to 0 and finite-q.

The lattice corrections to GW quasi-particle eigen-energies are evaluated numerically by constructing an Atomic Simulation Recipe (ASR) Python module within GPAW. It is emphasised that singularities arise that require special treatment. An analysis of the point-summation in q-space present solutions in a high k-point density, tuning of the infinitesimal eta parameter, and integrating micro-volumes in the Brillouin-Zone.

An energy mask is constructed to control the volume of q-space involved in the evaluation. The constructed ASR Python module is tested on Lithium-Fluoride. A cut-off energy of 2.0 eV is proven sufficient. This analysis also proved that inter-band matrix elements were negligible compared to intra-band matrix elements in the lattice corrections. The evaluation of the resulting band-structures presented a desired decrease in the GW band-gap. The results however also exhibited sporadic variations in the lattice corrections, which are attributed to the singularities occurring in the evaluation. The importance of the k-point density, eta value, and the effectiveness of the micro-volume integration method are presented and discussed.

    <div class="project-abstract">
Ph.D. research in tools for microscopists to utilise the power of deep learning neural networks to automate the analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. An investigation has been made to see whether neural networks can exceed human-level performance in seeing past noise and imperfections in the image and still extract the same quality of information, such as structural and chemical information.
